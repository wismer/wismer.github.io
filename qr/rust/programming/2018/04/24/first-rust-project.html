    <p>A year or so ago, I wanted to learn something far outside my comfort zone and chose to start learning Rust. 
A low-level systems programming language, <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> had things that I had no experience with, like strict typing, generic types, and the way Rust handles memory. I learn best by doing, so periodically I would try to learn some by making something, like my <a href="https://github.com/wismer/caesar-cipher">caesar-ciper</a>. But they were never deep enough to make me really grok the language.</p>

<p>Eventually I settled on making this:</p>

<div class="qr-hold">
  <img alt="SCAN ME!" src="/assets/img/qr.png" />
</div>

<h3 id="qr-encoder">QR Encoder</h3>

<p>I plan to delve more deeply into this in further posts, but let me finish by saying
that if you are looking for a project as a vehicle to learn a new language, you canâ€™t
go wrong with creating a QR code generator!</p>

.qr-hold {
