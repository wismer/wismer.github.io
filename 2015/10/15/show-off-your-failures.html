    <p>I had <strike>a good plan</strike></p>

<p>I had <strike>a plan</strike></p>

<p>I had <strike>an idea</strike></p>

<p>I had <strike>something</strike></p>

<p>Ok, I had nothing.</p>

<p>Originally I was going to do something way overly ambitious - write about learning
Rust over 100 days. Did that work out? It did for the first two weeks but I started
to run into a wall that I couldn’t get myself over. That borrow-checker gives me nightmares.</p>

<p>It reminds me over all my half-finished projects I’ve tinkered with, all with
varying degrees of determination and seriousness. Since I’ll probably never finish,
I’d be remiss if I didn’t at least talk about <em>why</em> I gave up on them.</p>

<h4 id="unsubberhttpsgithubcomwismerunsubber"><a href="https://github.com/wismer/unsubber">unsubber</a></h4>
<p>A Recurse Center project that connects with
gmail. It was to grep through emails looking for unsubscribe links and then submit
unsubscribe requests. Didn’t work - not all unsubscribe pages are made equal. <strong>Failure Grade: B-</strong></p>

<h4 id="git-addhttpsgithubcomwismergit-add"><a href="https://github.com/wismer/git-add">git-add</a></h4>
<p>A recent project that was pretty half-hearted from the get-go. I use the <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> text editor
at work and at home and wanted an easier way to grab blocks of code and with a shortcut, append a commit message (and git add, git push, etc) without having to use the terminal. The API for the editor is confusing, and written entirely in CoffeeScript - something I am not used to (and not particularly fond of). I didn’t get very far with this. <strong>Failure Grade: Lackluster</strong></p>

<h4 id="caesar-cipherhttpsgithubcomwismercaesar-cipher"><a href="https://github.com/wismer/caesar-cipher">caesar-cipher</a></h4>
<p>Technically, this is <em>complete</em>, but there’s a whole lot more I could do with this but I just couldn’t
find myself interested enough in it to continue. It encrypts and decrypts strings into and out of the Caesar Cryptograph method (I’m a big fan of non-complex crpyto and/or Roman History) <strong>Failure Grade: Not Useful</strong></p>

<h4 id="simple-api-serverhttpsgithubcomwismersimple-api-server"><a href="https://github.com/wismer/simple-api-server">simple-api-server</a></h4>
<p>This one was infuriating. An Ember front-end, Rust backend, it was supposed to serve
json data of a card game that I play, but I had so much trouble setting the headers correctly
in rust that I ultimately gave up on it. <strong>Failure Grade: Spectacular</strong></p>

<h4 id="one-hundred-days-of-rusthttpsgithubcomwismerone-hundred-days-of-rust"><a href="https://github.com/wismer/one-hundred-days-of-rust">one-hundred-days-of-rust</a></h4>
<p>Haha. So bad. <strong>Failure Grade: Gold Star for Effort</strong></p>

<h4 id="proxy-boxyhttpsgithubcomwismerproxy-boxy"><a href="https://github.com/wismer/proxy-boxy">proxy-boxy</a></h4>
<p>When I was too stubborn to learn how to use Jekyll, I tried to make my own blog. It was
very, <em>very</em> ugly. I even had a fellow RC friend tell me that it was so bad it was funny (he meant well) <strong>Failure Grade: Good god, this is really ugly</strong></p>

<h4 id="react-syntax-highlighterhttpsgistgithubcomwismerc6108b5d3d08496353d0"><a href="https://gist.github.com/wismer/c6108b5d3d08496353d0">react-syntax-highlighter</a></h4>
<p>I was too frustrated with the syntax highlighters for Jekyll not working right with Rust that
I attempted to write my own in React. So, I essentially doubled the amount of work I intended to do. The intention was to
highlight how the stack and the heap is used in Rust but I couldn’t think of a good example to follow through with. <strong>Failure Grade: Neat Idea, too bad it sucks</strong></p>

<p>I’ve got many more failed projects/posts but I didn’t want to spend too much time writing them up
or else this post would have met the same demise as those listed above.</p>

<p>Anyway, I failed. Frequently. Sometimes I gave up because there was a voice in my head
telling me that I was stupid and that I should feel bad for my shoddy work, sometimes I just get distracted by
something else.</p>

<p>But that’s ok.</p>

<p>I’m still curious and will always continue to be.</p>
