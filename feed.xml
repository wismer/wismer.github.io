A low-level systems programming language, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rust-lang.org&quot;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt; had things that I had no experience with, like strict typing, generic types, and the way Rust handles memory. I learn best by doing, so periodically I would try to learn some by making something, like my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wismer/caesar-cipher&quot;&gt;caesar-ciper&lt;/a&gt;. But they were never deep enough to make me really grok the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I settled on making this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;qr-hold&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;SCAN ME!&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/qr.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;qr-encoder&quot;&gt;QR Encoder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to delve more deeply into this in further posts, but let me finish by saying
that if you are looking for a project as a vehicle to learn a new language, you canâ€™t
go wrong with creating a QR code generator!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
.qr-hold {
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: 400px;
